# Unit Testing

## Software Development Testing
---
Testing components of your software to test situations you wouldn't always expect, such as testing for null and object types 

---

## Benefits

You can discover bugs and vulnerabilities before the application goes into production.

---

## Drawbacks
---
Takes extra time and effort to set up unit testing for software and might not always be neccessary for every application.
