# **Git It, Got It, Goood**

## Why Use Git?

---
Git allows multiple developers and multiple versions to run off of the same code. 

---

## Benefits of Branches

---
Branches allow you to test experimental code changes to the main branch without affecting the base code. You can then merge experimental branches whenever you want. 

---

## Git vs. GitHub

---
Github is a service for hosting repositories on the internet for developers, Git is the version control system that stores the code on local repositories.
