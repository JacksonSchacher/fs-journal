# Encapsulation

## Purpose
---
Bundles data, restricts direct access to functions and changing data for end users. 

---

## Problems
---
underscores rely on the user to know what it means and understand they are not indended for them.
---

## Private Variables
---
private variables can be made by hiding them inside class constructors and using get and set functions to access them.
