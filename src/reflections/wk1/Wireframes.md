# Wireframes

## Purpose of Wire-Framing

---
Allows rapid prototyping of functionality, design and usabilty with you product

---

## Levels of Detail

---
Wireframes can be low-fidelity, mid-fidelity, and high-fidelity. Lower end wireframes are good for layout and big concept, mid level is good for functionality and addressing device specific issues, high fidelity is good for design and small tweaks to form and function.

---

## Worth It?

---
I use wireframes often to sketch out design ideas before commiting to a long project. They are very worth the effort, time and energy in finding issues before you commit to a full build.
