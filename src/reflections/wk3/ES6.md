# ES6 Modules

## Using Exports
---
index HTML only needs to grab one js file to run code, your main.js imports all neccessary code 

---

## Export vs Export Default
---
named exports must be imported with the same name, you can only have one export default 

---

## Module System
---
Benefits of module system are that your files are smaller, debugging is easier, less naming conflicts.
