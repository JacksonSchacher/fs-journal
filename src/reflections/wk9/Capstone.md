# Capstone

## Technologies
---
We are using RESTful Api methods, we are utilizing MongoDB, Auth0. We are using Bootstrap style format. 

---

## Going Well
---
My team is working very well with getting the mock to follow the design Figma accurately. We are all managing our individual sections well.

---

## Different
---
I would focus more on using MapBoxGL in the early week and getting that section of the project complete first.
