# Vue Testing

## Types of Testing
---
Unit Testing - Individual units of code in isolation.
Component Testing - Reliable testing of components by mounting them to the DOM and see if they are working.
End-To-End Testing - Coverage on what happens when a user uses your application

---

## Most Useful
---
End To End: This is testing what your application is like live. It's the ultimate test for a successful application

---

## Least Useful
---
Unit Testing: By doing the other two types of testing well the unit testing becomes redundant.
